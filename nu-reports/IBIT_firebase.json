  "ai_analysis": {
    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BEARISH - Price structure shows overwhelming weakness (0.8 confidence) as the asset trades below the 20, 50, and 200-day moving averages, confirmed by a Bearish MACD.\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE BELOW ALL MAs - This establishes a clear, multi-timeframe structural downtrend. The long-term technical foundation remains firmly bearish until price breaches and holds above key resistance levels.\n3. **Momentum:** Structurally Bearish - Current momentum is clearly downward, entrenched by the bearish positioning of price relative to MAs. The MA Ribbon Spread confirms that the trend is established, rather than consolidating.\n4. **Risk Factor:** Timing Inflection - The FIB TIME ZONE 5 (0.6 confidence) introduces an imminent timing factor. While the structural bias is bearish, this signal often precedes a period of increased volatility, potential pivot, or a temporary counter-trend move (e.g., a mean reversion bounce) before the primary trend resumes.\n5. **Action:** Short Bias Maintained - Traders should favor short setups or maintenance of existing short positions. However, due to the high-confidence timing signal, protective stops should be actively managed or tightened in anticipation of potential volatility or a temporary relief rally.",
