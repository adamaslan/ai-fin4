  "ai_analysis": {
    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BULLISH - Supported by structural trend health (Price above 20, 50, and 200 MAs, 80% confidence), although momentum is overwhelmingly weak and conflicting.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs - Confirms the long-term trend is structurally robust. The foundation for the asset remains strong, indicating that current pullbacks should find support at these moving average levels.\n\n3. **Momentum:** WEAK/CONSOLIDATING - The majority of signals (RSI neutral at 47.8, MAs spread, Fib Channel positioning) point to consolidation. This is further complicated by the contextual bearish MACD reading, creating a conflict between structural strength and short-term directional inertia.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** MOMENTUM DIVERGENCE & TIME PIVOT - The conflict between the 80% confident structural bullishness and the bearish MACD/neutral RSI is the primary short-term risk. Additionally, the asset is aligning with the FIB TIME ZONE 34, suggesting a potential high-volatility directional pivot is imminent.\n\n5. **Action:** WAIT FOR MOMENTUM CONFIRMATION - Maintain a constructive bias, but defer aggressive long entries. Wait for the RSI to cross above 50 or for the MACD to confirm a bullish crossover, using the closest supporting moving average as the critical stop-loss level.",
