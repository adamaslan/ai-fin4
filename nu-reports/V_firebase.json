    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** NEUTRAL - Extreme conflict between long-term bullish structure (0.8 confidence) and short-term overbought exhaustion (0.65 confidence). The market is poised for a necessary correction or consolidation.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs (Confidence 0.8) - This signal confirms that the long-term structural trend remains strongly Bullish. All moving averages (20, 50, 200) are aligned in support, indicating that any near-term decline is likely a pullback within a broader uptrend.\n\n3. **Momentum:** EXHAUSTED (Short-Term) - Momentum is highly fatigued, evidenced by the extreme Overbought readings (RSI 80.5 and Stochastic 94.0). This exhaustion, coupled with a Bearish MACD, suggests immediate deceleration and high potential for a short-term mean-reversion move.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** Imminent Pullback - The primary risk is a sharp corrective move driven by the extreme overbought conditions. Traders must respect the oscillators, which signal a necessary cooling-off period is underway before the established uptrend can sustainably continue.\n\n5. **Action:** AVOID NEW LONG ENTRIES - Focus on observing the critical FIB CONFLUENCE zone (0.8 confidence) as potential support. Wait for price to correct, relieve the overbought pressure, and confirm a bounce near key structural support levels before initiating new bullish positions.",
