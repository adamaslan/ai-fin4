    "signal_summary": "**Analyst Synthesis Report**\n\n| Metric | Analysis |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **1. Primary Bias** | **NEUTRAL** - Technical analysis is defined by three converging neutral signals, indicating the asset is currently resting at a critical equilibrium/pivot point (led by 0.7 confidence signal). |\n| **2. Key Signal** | **FIB RETRACE 38.2%** - Price is positioned directly at a key Fibonacci support level. This level defines the current consolidation and will act as a critical pivot for the next significant directional move. |\n| **3. Momentum** | **WEAK BEARISH PRESSURE** - While the MACD is signaling bearish momentum, the MA Ribbon Spread suggests the current trend structure is weak or transitioning. The overall context is one of stabilization rather than directional acceleration. |\n| **4. Risk Factor** | **CRITICAL FIBONACCI FAILURE** - The primary risk is a decisive breach and close below the 38.2% Fib Retrace level. This would likely confirm the intermediate bearish MACD signal and trigger accelerated selling pressure towards lower support levels. |\n| **5. Action** | **WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION** - Maintain a non-directional stance. Establish clear trade boundaries around the current Fib channel (23.6%-38.2%) and wait for a confirmed, high-volume breakout or breakdown before initiating a directional position. |",
