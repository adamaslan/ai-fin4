    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BEARISH - The only directional signal is the rejection at the 23.6% Fibonacci level (0.65 confidence), supported by a Bearish MACD reading.\n2. **Key Signal:** FIB 23.6% REJECTION - This indicates that short-term resistance is holding firm, signaling that sellers are currently stepping in at this critical technical level to prevent a deeper recovery.\n3. **Momentum:** BEARISH/WEAK - While the immediate price action and MACD are bearish, the MA RIBBON SPREAD (0.60 confidence) suggests a potential transition phase or consolidation, indicating a lack of strong directional momentum conviction.\n4. **Risk Factor:** TREND AMBIGUITY - The overall signal summary is dominated by two Neutral signals, suggesting the asset may be entering a chop or consolidation phase rather than a definitive, strong downtrend.\n5. **Action:** SHORT BIAS/DEFENSIVE - Traders should favor short positions or maintain a defensive stance, using the rejected 23.6% Fib level as a key reference for resistance. Wait for a confirmation break of local support before aggressively entering new positions.",
