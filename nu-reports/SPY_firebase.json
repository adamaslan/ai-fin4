  "ai_analysis": {
    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BULLISH - The market maintains a strong structural and long-term bullish posture, anchored by three high-confidence (C: 0.8) Fibonacci confluence signals and the price trading above all major moving averages. Short-term bearish pressure is currently viewed as corrective.\n2. **Key Signal:** FIB CONFLUENCE (3 levels) - This extreme bullish signal (C: 0.8) pinpoints a critical structural support zone. Holding this zone is essential to validating the underlying uptrend and negating the short-term bearish indicators.\n3. **Momentum:** DECELERATING BULLISH - While the price remains in a dominant long-term uptrend (above 20/50/200 MAs), immediate momentum has stalled. The 10/20 MA Bear Cross (C: 0.7) and Overbought Stochastic (C: 0.65), coupled with a bearish MACD, signal a high likelihood of a near-term cooling period or correction.\n4. **Risk Factor:** SHORT-TERM PULLBACK - The confluence of the Stochastic Overbought condition and the 10/20 MA Bear Cross indicates substantial short-term risk of a pullback toward the identified Fibonacci support levels before a potential continuation of the primary trend.\n5. **Action:** ACCUMULATE ON PULLBACKS - Adopt a disciplined approach, avoiding long entries based on current overbought conditions. Instead, establish accumulation targets near the critical Fibonacci confluence levels, treating any immediate dip as a high-probability entry point within the broader uptrend.",
