    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** NEUTRAL - Structural Bullish trend (Price > MAs, 80% confidence) is immediately contradicted by strong short-term bearish momentum signals (Stochastic cross/overbought, 70% confidence).\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs (0.8 confidence) - The asset maintains a structurally strong Bullish position, trading above its major trend averages (20, 50, 200). This sets the long-term supportive context.\n3. **Momentum:** DECELERATING/SHORT-TERM BEARISH. High-confidence Stochastic signals indicate the recent upward impulse is exhausted, warning of a potential reversal or significant pullback due to the asset being overbought (%K > 80) and the signal line crossing down.\n4. **Risk Factor:** IMMINENT PULLBACK. The convergence of the Stochastic bearish cross (0.7 confidence) and the already Bearish MACD suggests high risk that the asset will test nearest support levels to relieve overbought conditions.\n5. **Action:** CAUTION/WAIT FOR PULLBACK. Avoid initiating new long positions until the overbought momentum has corrected. Traders should monitor the major Moving Averages as potential strong support zones if the anticipated pullback materializes.",
