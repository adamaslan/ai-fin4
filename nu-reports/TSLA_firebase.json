    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** NEUTRAL - Conflict between high-confidence structural support (Bullish 0.8) and strong immediate momentum exhaustion (Bearish 0.7).\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs (0.8) - This establishes that the underlying, medium-to-long term trend remains robustly upward, as price is holding above the 20, 50, and 200 period moving averages.\n3. **Momentum:** Bearish Exhaustion - Immediate momentum signals (Stochastic Overbought and Bearish Cross, combined with Bearish MACD context) overwhelmingly indicate short-term selling pressure and market exhaustion at current price levels.\n4. **Risk Factor:** Reversion to Mean - The primary risk is a rapid correction to reset the overbought conditions, likely targeting the nearest major moving average (e.g., the 20 MA) to test underlying support before any further uptrend continuation.\n5. **Action:** Wait for Pullback - Avoid aggressive long positions until the Stochastic signals reset below the overbought threshold (80) or until price successfully tests and bounces off a key moving average support level.",
