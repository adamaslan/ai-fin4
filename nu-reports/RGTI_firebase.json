    "signal_summary": "## TRADING ANALYST SYNTHESIS\n\n**1. Primary Bias:** NEUTRAL - (100% of technical signals indicate non-directional price action focusing heavily on structural timing and transition.)\n\n**2. Key Signal:** FIBONACCI TIME ZONE CONFLUENCE (5, 8, 21) - The simultaneous alignment of three major Fibonacci time cycles suggests the current bar is a critical temporal inflection point. This confluence points toward a high probability of an imminent change in price tempo or a significant structural reversal/continuation setup, though the direction remains unconfirmed.\n\n**3. Momentum:** TRANSITIONAL/WEAK - The MA Ribbon Spread indicates MAs are widely dispersed, often occurring during trend deceleration or structural transition. While the external MACD context is Bearish, the overall signal profile suggests directional conviction is currently low and the market may be consolidating before the next confirmed move.\n\n**4. Risk Factor:** IMMINENT VOLATILITY SPIKE - The concentrated presence of Fibonacci time signals significantly increases the risk that price action will become volatile or that a sharp directional impulse will occur immediately following the expiry of these time zones.\n\n**5. Action:** WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION - Due to the confluence of timing signals and structural ambiguity, entry or expansion of positions is discouraged. Traders should wait for a decisive directional break (above resistance or below support) to confirm the next trend, or prepare to adjust existing stop-losses for potential volatility.",
