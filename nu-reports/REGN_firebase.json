    "signal_summary": "## Trading Signal Synthesis\n\n| Metric | Detail |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Total Signals | 5 (1 Bullish, 2 Bearish, 2 Neutral) |\n| Highest Confidence | BULLISH (Price Above MAs, 0.8) |\n| Conflicting Signals | Structural Bullishness vs. Momentum Exhaustion |\n\n---\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n1.  **Primary Bias:** **BEARISH (Short-Term)** - Driven by synchronous overbought conditions in both RSI (70.3) and Stochastic (%K 93.0). The immediate risk is a sharp reversal or significant profit-taking, despite the established uptrend structure.\n2.  **Key Signal:** **PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs (Confidence 0.8)** - This is the strongest structural signal, confirming that the underlying, longer-term trend remains fundamentally Bullish. The uptrend structure is intact, but the price level is overextended relative to its moving averages.\n3.  **Momentum:** **OVEREXTENDED AND EXHAUSTED** - Momentum indicators suggest the recent bullish impulse is unsustainable. This exhaustion is reinforced by the \"MA RIBBON SPREAD\" neutral signal, indicating a potential weakening or slowing of the trending pace.\n4.  **Risk Factor:** **Structural Support Failure** - The primary risk to a short-term bearish thesis is the high-confidence long-term uptrend. Any significant pullback is likely to encounter strong buying interest around the nearest MAs, turning the dip into a potential buying opportunity.\n5.  **Action:** **TIGHTEN STOPS ON LONGS / AWAIT PULLBACK** - Traders holding long positions should prioritize capital protection by tightening stops. New entry strategies should focus on short-term bearish fades or waiting for a confirmed retracement (using MAs as targets) to re-establish long positions at a more favorable risk/reward level.",
