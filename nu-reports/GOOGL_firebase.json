    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BULLISH - Based on the dominant structural support indicated by the price being above all major MAs (0.8 confidence), establishing a clear uptrend across multiple time frames.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs - This high-confidence signal confirms the technical foundation of the market is structurally strong, with major moving averages (20, 50, 200) acting as robust support levels below the current price ($314.09).\n\n3. **Momentum:** STALLED UPTREND - While the long-term structure is bullish, short-term momentum is absent. The neutral RSI (47.2) and the active Fibonacci time/channel signals indicate the asset is currently in a consolidation phase rather than a strong directional move.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** MACD Divergence - The bearish reading from the MACD is a critical contradiction to the high-confidence bullish MA signal. This suggests that while price structure is sound, underlying momentum and trend strength are deteriorating.\n\n5. **Action:** Maintain Long Bias - Given the structural support, maintain a long bias. However, delay aggressive accumulation until the current consolidation phase (RSI Neutral) resolves and the MACD confirms renewed upward momentum, mitigating the risk of a potential downturn at the sensitive Fib Time Zone 34.",
