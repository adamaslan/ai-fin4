  "ai_analysis": {
    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** NEUTRAL - All high-confidence signals (60%) indicate market consolidation and a lack of strong directional conviction.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** MA RIBBON SPREAD - The MAs are spread apart, suggesting either a very weak, elongated trend or a market transitioning between structural phases. This structurally validates the current consolidation environment.\n\n3. **Momentum:** WEAK BEARISH DRIFT - Although technical price action is neutral and range-bound, the underlying MACD reading signals existing bearish momentum, suggesting that the path of least resistance remains cautiously to the downside should the current range fail.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** STRUCTURAL UNCERTAINTY - The MA spread and the price holding within the mid-range Fibonacci channel (23.6%-38.2%) indicate that the market is coiled. The primary risk is a high-volatility impulse move or structural breakdown once the current range is resolved.\n\n5. **Action:** OBSERVE/RANGE TRADE - Traders should maintain a defensive posture. Focus on defined support and resistance levels dictated by the Fibonacci channel for short-term range trades, but refrain from initiating major directional exposure until a clear breakout or trend confirmation is registered by the moving averages.",
