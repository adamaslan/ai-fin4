    "signal_summary": "## Trading Analyst Synthesis\n\n---\n\n1.  **Primary Bias:** NEUTRAL - **(Conflicting Signals)** The strong structural bullish trend (Price above MAs, 80% confidence) is directly contradicted by immediate technical exhaustion signals (RSI/Stochastic Overbought, 65% confidence each) and a bearish MACD reading.\n\n2.  **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs (Confidence 0.8) - This signal confirms that the structural, long-term trend remains firmly bullish, establishing a foundational uptrend that supports buying dips rather than shorting aggressively.\n\n3.  **Momentum:** Extreme Overbought/Exhaustion - Short-term momentum is peaking. Both the RSI (79.4) and Stochastic (84.7) are deep into overbought territory, signaling that the recent upward drive is highly exhausted and a corrective move is imminent.\n\n4.  **Risk Factor:** High Retracement Risk - The market is facing immediate resistance, confirmed by the price precisely hitting the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement level concurrently with a Fibonacci Time Zone indicator (8 bars). This convergence of time and price resistance increases the probability of a sharp, near-term pullback.\n\n5.  **Action:** Wait for Confirmation/Avoid New Longs - Traders should refrain from initiating new long positions at current levels ($110.68) due to high retracement risk. The implied trade setup is to wait for a corrective dip towards key moving averages (the structural support) or for definitive confirmation of a breakdown below the 78.6% Fib level.",
