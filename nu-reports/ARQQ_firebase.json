  "ai_analysis": {
    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BEARISH - Strong structural downside pressure confirmed by price below all major moving averages (0.8 confidence) and contextual bearish MACD.\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE BELOW ALL MAs - This is the highest-confidence signal, confirming that the asset is in a firm, long-term downtrend structure, utilizing the 20, 50, and 200 MAs as overhead resistance.\n3. **Momentum:** Strong Bearish - The MA positioning indicates sustained negative pressure, supported by the explicitly bearish MACD reading, confirming the directional momentum is downward.\n4. **Risk Factor:** Timing Reversal - The concurrent activation of two separate Fibonacci Time Zones (5 and 34) introduces a significant risk that the current bar marks an inflection point, potentially leading to a short-term corrective bounce or trend pause.\n5. **Action:** Maintain short positions but prioritize defensive management (e.g., tightening stops) due to the converging Fib timing zones. New short entries should wait for confirmation that the established bearish trend has broken through the potential time-based inflection point.",
