    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BEARISH - Structural Price Weakness (Confidence 80%). The highest confidence signal confirms price is trading below all major moving averages (20, 50, 200), solidifying the structural downtrend, which is further supported by a bearish MACD.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE BELOW ALL MAs - This is the strongest signal, indicating broad market capitulation across short, medium, and long-term horizons. Until price reclaims a major moving average, the default expectation is lower prices.\n\n3. **Momentum:** Established Downward Pressure. While the MA ribbon spread suggests the trend is stable (not accelerating sharply), the RSI at 42.2 confirms downward momentum is still active and pushing the asset toward the oversold territory.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** Short-Term Reversion Risk. The RSI trending into the mid-40s (42.2) increases the potential for a near-term relief bounce. Sellers should be wary of a temporary technical rally once the RSI hits the conventional oversold threshold (30).\n\n5. **Action:** Maintain a short bias, but employ tactical vigilance. Focus on initiating short positions on bounces back toward near-term resistance (e.g., the 20d MA), treating any relief rally as a selling opportunity until the structural price weakness is broken.",
