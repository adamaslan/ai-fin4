    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BULLISH - Based on the highest confidence signal (0.80) indicating strong structural support with the price trading above all critical moving averages (20, 50, 200).\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs - This structural setup establishes a dominant long-term uptrend, reinforcing the foundation for higher prices despite immediate tactical warnings.\n3. **Momentum:** Bullish (Structural) but Exhausted (Tactical) - While the MACD is bearish and the MAs are spread (suggesting a weakening pace), the primary issue is the overbought reading on the Stochastic (89.5), indicating immediate upward momentum is highly stretched.\n4. **Risk Factor:** STOCHASTIC OVERBOUGHT (89.5) - The immediate risk is a sharp mean reversion or consolidation. The tactical signal suggests a high probability of a short-term pullback to relieve the stretched condition before a continuation of the structural uptrend.\n5. **Action:** Wait for Pullback - Avoid initiating new long positions at the current price ($462.99). Focus on monitoring price action for a retracement toward key moving average support zones to find an entry with a superior risk/reward profile.",
