    "signal_summary": "## Trading Analyst Synthesis\n\n| Output Point | Analysis |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **1. Primary Bias:** | **BULLISH** (Structural) - Based on the highest confidence signal, **Price Above All MAs** (0.8 confidence), which confirms a strong, established uptrend across multiple time horizons. |\n| **2. Key Signal:** | **PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs** (0.8 Confidence) - This structural confirmation indicates definitive strength. The price is currently holding above the 20, 50, and 200 period moving averages, confirming the path of least resistance is upward. |\n| **3. Momentum:** | **Exhausted/Mixed.** While the underlying trend is strong, momentum is stretched. The **Stochastic Overbought** signal (90.4) suggests immediate buying pressure is exhausted, and the prevailing MACD context is Bearish, signaling rising downside risk despite the strong trend. |\n| **4. Risk Factor:** | **Imminent Pullback/Correction.** The combination of an extremely high Stochastic reading (90.4) and the simultaneous Neutral signals (FIB Channel 38.2%-50.0%) suggests price is ripe for a short-term correction back toward support levels before the structural uptrend can continue. |\n| **5. Action:** | **Wait for Retracement.** Aggressive long entries should be avoided at $188.61. Traders should look to establish or add to long positions only after a meaningful retracement occurs, ideally testing the support established within the indicated **Fibonacci channel (38.2%-50.0%)** or a key moving average. |",
