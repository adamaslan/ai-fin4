    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BEARISH - Structural downtrend confirmed by price action below all major moving averages (0.8 confidence) and bearish MACD signals.\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE BELOW ALL MAs - This establishes a critical structural bearish bias, indicating that the asset is in a long-term downtrend, making short positions fundamentally favored.\n3. **Momentum:** WEAK/CONSOLIDATING DOWNWARD - While the structure is bearish, the Neutral RSI (46.0) and the price being confined within the tight Fibonacci channel (23.6%-38.2%) suggest that current momentum is pausing or consolidating rather than aggressively declining.\n4. **Risk Factor:** RANGE TRADING/SUPPORT HOLD - The concentration of neutral signals (RSI, Fib channel confinement) indicates high risk of choppiness or range trading. The current support level (23.6% Fib) must be broken to confirm the continuation of the bearish trend.\n5. **Action:** CONFIRMATION SHORT - Maintain a short bias, but avoid premature entry. Wait for a decisive close below the lower boundary of the current Fibonacci consolidation channel (23.6%) to confirm a breakout and sustainable downside continuation.",
