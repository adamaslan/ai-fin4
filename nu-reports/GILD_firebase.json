    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BULLISH - The high-confidence structural signal (Price Above All MAs, 0.8 confidence) establishes a long-term uptrend despite conflicting short-term momentum signals.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs - This signal is the strongest structural indicator (0.8 confidence), confirming that the long-term trend remains firmly in an uptrend (above the 20, 50, and 200 MAs). Pullbacks should be viewed within the context of a potential continuation.\n\n3. **Momentum:** WEAKENING/MIXED - The MACD is currently bearish, indicating recent downward momentum that is challenging the established bullish structure. This short-term weakness is reinforced by the MA Ribbon Spread signal (0.6 confidence), suggesting the velocity of the primary trend is reducing or entering a consolidation phase.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** FIBONACCI INFLECTION POINT - Price is sitting precisely at the critical 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement (0.7 confidence). This level must hold as support. A decisive break below this point, while short-term MACD momentum is already bearish, would seriously threaten the structural integrity confirmed by the moving averages.\n\n5. **Action:** CONSOLIDATION WATCH - The immediate implication is to wait for confirmation of a bounce off the 78.6% Fib support. Trades should favor long positions only if the bearish MACD starts to flatten or reverse, validating the underlying bullish structure indicated by the MAs.",
