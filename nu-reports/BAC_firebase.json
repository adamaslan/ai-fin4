  "ai_analysis": {
    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** **NEUTRAL** - Strong conflict between high-confidence structural bullishness (Price > MAs, 0.8) and immediate short-term momentum exhaustion (RSI and Stochastic Overbought, 2x 0.65 Bearish signals).\n\n2. **Key Signal:** **PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs (20, 50, 200)** - This is the highest confidence directional signal (0.8), confirming that the underlying structure is firmly bullish and suggesting that any weakness will likely be a corrective pullback within an established uptrend.\n\n3. **Momentum:** **OVEREXTENDED/WEAKENING** - Short-term momentum is severely exhausted. Both RSI (72.2) and Stochastic (92.2) are deeply overbought, indicating that the recent move higher is unsustainable and highly vulnerable to profit-taking. The existing bearish MACD reading supports this view of slowing positive acceleration.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** **Synchronous Overbought Condition** - The strongest immediate risk is the simultaneous overbought status of both the RSI and Stochastic oscillators, signaling a technical correction is highly probable. This risk is amplified by the presence of a strong underlying trend that often leads to sharp, short-term pullbacks before continuation.\n\n5. **Action:** **CAUTION/WAIT FOR PULLBACK** - Traders should avoid initiating new long positions at the current price ($56.25). Priority should be placed on monitoring potential support entry points, particularly the confirmed **FIB CONFLUENCE** zones (38.2% and 50.0%), to establish a healthier entry after the short-term overbought condition resolves.",
