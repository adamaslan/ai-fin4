  "ai_analysis": {
    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** NEUTRAL - 100% of analyzed technical signals confirm consolidation and lack of strong directional trend.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** MA RIBBON SPREAD - This signal, along with the price holding within the FIB CHANNEL (61.8%-78.6%), confirms that the market is currently in a non-trending, transitional state, prohibiting clear directional trades.\n\n3. **Momentum:** STALLED / WEAKENING DOWNWARD - Recent downward pressure (indicated by the Bearish MACD) has diminished, resulting in the RSI stabilizing at 42.0 (neutral) and the price entering a holding pattern.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** BEARISH RESOLUTION - The underlying bearish MACD suggests that while the market is consolidating, the path of least resistance remains downward if the price breaks out of the defined Fibonacci Channel support zone.\n\n5. **Action:** MONITOR FOR BREAKOUT - Traders should maintain a neutral stance and avoid directional entries. Focus on monitoring the price action for a decisive break out of the 61.8%-78.6% Fibonacci range, noting that the FIB TIME ZONE 8 suggests a decision point may be approaching.",
