    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BULLISH - Structural support confirmed by price remaining above all key moving averages (0.8 confidence). The long-term trend remains firmly positive, despite immediate headwinds.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs - This is the highest conviction signal (C: 0.8). It confirms the established long-term uptrend and dictates that any short-term weakness should fundamentally be treated as a potential buying opportunity within the broader structure.\n\n3. **Momentum:** BEARISH PULLBACK IMMINENT - Short-term momentum is exhausted. Stochastic indicators (C: 0.7 & 0.65) show overbought conditions and a %K cross below %D, signaling an immediate shift in selling pressure. This is reinforced by the bearish MACD context.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** SHORT-TERM REVERSAL (MEAN REVERSION) - The primary risk is a mandatory short-term reversal driven by the overbought oscillator readings. Price is highly likely to retreat to key moving average support levels or consolidate near the critical 78.6% Fibonacci level before attempting a continuation higher.\n\n5. **Action:** AVOID NEW LONG ENTRIES - Do not initiate new long positions at the current extended price ($194.17). Wait for the anticipated mean reversion to complete and seek confirmation of support (e.g., at the 20 or 50 MA levels) before entering in line with the primary bullish trend.",
