    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** NEUTRAL - Structural bullish strength (Price Above MAs, 80% confidence) is severely counterbalanced by a confluence of overbought momentum signals (RSI/Stochastic Overbought, 65% combined confidence) requiring immediate price cooling.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs (Confidence 0.80). This confirms a robust, higher-timeframe bullish trend structure is intact (20, 50, and 200 MAs), suggesting that any short-term pullback is likely to be a corrective dip rather than a trend reversal.\n\n3. **Momentum:** Exhausted/Bearish. Both RSI (87.5) and Stochastic (97.4) show extreme momentum exhaustion. This strongly implies that the recent upward drive is unsustainable in the short term, positioning the asset for an imminent consolidation or corrective pullback, reinforced by a bearish MACD context.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** Mean Reversion Risk. The extreme overbought reading on the RSI (87.5) creates a high probability of a sharp, rapid reversion to the mean. This is the primary near-term risk to existing long positions.\n\n5. **Action:** AVOID opening new long positions at the current level ($411.93). The prudent action is to wait for the inevitable pullback to test the short-term support MAs or for momentum indicators to reset to more neutral levels before considering re-entry into the structural bull trend.",
