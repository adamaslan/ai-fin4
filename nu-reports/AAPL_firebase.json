    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** NEUTRAL - (Confidence 100%)\n    The current environment is characterized by a high-confidence technical pause, as all four analyzed signals are neutral. Price is positioned at critical structural inflection points (Fibonacci levels), implying a major decision is imminent, but not yet resolved.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** FIB RETRACE 61.8% (Confidence 0.7) -\n    This is the highest confidence technical barrier. Price is testing a major retracement level, which often serves as a critical support or resistance area. Holding this level is paramount for maintaining any prior structural integrity; failure suggests a deeper correction.\n\n3. **Momentum:** CONTESTED/TRANSITIONAL -\n    While the underlying MACD indicates a bearish trend, the MA Ribbon Spread signal suggests the prevailing trend is weakening or transitioning. The alignment with the FIB TIME ZONE 5 (Confidence 0.6) reinforces the view that the current period is a critical time window for structural change.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** HIGH VOLATILITY RESOLUTION -\n    The strong confluence of Fibonacci signals (61.8% retracement and channel placement) creates a high-energy zone. The primary risk is a sharp, sudden directional breakout once the price confirms whether it will hold or fail the 61.8% level.\n\n5. **Action:** MONITOR FOR CONFIRMATION -\n    Avoid initiating new directional trades immediately. Professional focus should be on the confirmation of a break above or below the critical 61.8% retracement level. Prepare entry strategies for the ensuing high-volatility move once the market commits to a direction.",
