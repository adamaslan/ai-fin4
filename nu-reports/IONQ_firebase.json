  "ai_analysis": {
    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** NEUTRAL - Current signal aggregation shows 100% of high-confidence technical indicators pointing to market indecision and consolidation.\n2. **Key Signal:** MA RIBBON SPREAD - The widespread nature of the Moving Average ribbon suggests the asset is currently in a weak, stalled trend or is transitioning between major directional movements, confirming the neutral structural environment.\n3. **Momentum:** Weakening Bearish Pressure. Despite the technical neutrality, the contextual MACD is bearish, and the RSI (42.6) is trending lower toward the oversold threshold, indicating underlying selling pressure or trend fatigue.\n4. **Risk Factor:** Time-Based Volatility. The FIB TIME ZONE 5 signal suggests the market may be nearing a time-based reaction point, which, combined with the underlying bearish momentum, increases the risk of a sharp breakdown out of the current consolidation channel.\n5. **Action:** Range Trading/Wait for Confirmation. Establish the boundaries defined by the FIB CHANNEL (23.6%-38.2%) and trade the range, or maintain a sidelined posture until a high-volume break confirms the next directional move, ideally confirming or invalidating the contextual bearish signal.",
