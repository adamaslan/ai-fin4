  "ai_analysis": {
    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BULLISH (Conditional) - Structural trend is strongly established (Price above all MAs, 80% confidence), but immediate tactical exhaustion points to high reversal risk.\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs - This is the highest confidence signal (0.8) and confirms that the underlying long-term market structure is firmly in an uptrend (bullish confirmation across short, medium, and long-term MAs).\n3. **Momentum:** Exhausted/Overbought - Despite the structural uptrend, the high RSI reading (78.2) clearly indicates short-term overbought conditions, increasing the probability of an immediate pullback. This is reinforced by the Bearish MACD context.\n4. **Risk Factor:** Critical Resistance & Reversion - Price is currently positioned exactly at the critical 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement level while simultaneously being overbought. This convergence of technical resistance and exhaustion creates a high-risk zone for a sharp reversal or consolidation phase.\n5. **Action:** Wait for Pullback or Breakout Confirmation - Avoid initiating new long positions at current levels ($32.75). The prudent strategy is to wait for a technical pullback toward established MA support levels or confirmation via a decisive, high-volume break above the 78.6% resistance before attempting to trade higher.",
