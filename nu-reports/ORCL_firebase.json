    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BEARISH - The structural weakness is confirmed by the price trading below the 20, 50, and 200 moving averages (80% confidence).\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE BELOW ALL MAs - This high-confidence signal confirms that the short, medium, and long-term trend structures are aligned to the downside, defining the current market as a downtrend.\n3. **Momentum:** MODERATE DOWNTREND - The MACD is bearish, providing confirmation. The RSI at 40.2 is moving toward the oversold territory, suggesting continued room for downside before reaching exhaustion. The MA Ribbon Spread indicates a defined, rather than choppy, trend.\n4. **Risk Factor:** TACTICAL REBOUND POTENTIAL - The RSI is approaching the oversold threshold, and the simultaneous \"FIB TIME ZONE 5\" signal suggests that a time-based inflection point or short-term relief bounce may be imminent despite the overriding bearish trend.\n5. **Action:** MAINTAIN BEARISH STANCE - Favor short positions or use rallies toward moving average resistance levels as potential short entry points. Avoid initiating long positions until price action structurally reclaims key averages.",
