    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BEARISH - Strong technical confirmation (80% confidence) that the instrument is weak across all major time horizons.\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE BELOW ALL MAs (20/50/200) - This confirms institutional technical breakdown, establishing the market structure firmly in a downtrend.\n3. **Momentum:** Downward, Established - Both MACD and price action confirm negative momentum. The trend is mature, but the \"MA Ribbon Spread\" (Neutral 0.6) suggests the pace of the decline may decelerate or consolidate.\n4. **Risk Factor:** Technical Overextension - The wide MA ribbon spread indicates that the price is significantly extended below its moving averages, increasing the near-term risk of a counter-trend mean reversion bounce or consolidation.\n5. **Action:** Maintain or Establish Short Position - Favor selling strength or holding current short exposure. Entry timing should be disciplined, potentially looking for a retest of the nearest moving average resistance rather than shorting at current depressed levels.",
