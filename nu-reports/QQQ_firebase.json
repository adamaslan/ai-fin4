    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BULLISH - 80% confidence\n    The market exhibits a clear structural uptrend confirmed by Price trading above the 20, 50, and 200 moving averages. This long-term strength is being reinforced by an immediate momentum shift signalled by the high-confidence MACD Bull Cross.\n\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE ABOVE ALL MAs - Structural Trend Confirmation\n    This signal (0.8 confidence) is paramount, confirming that the current price level is maintaining structural integrity across short, medium, and long-term horizons. It sets a strong foundation for trend continuation and implies that recent selling was likely just a deeper correction within an existing uptrend.\n\n3. **Momentum:** Positive Shift/Reversal\n    Momentum is turning positive, driven by the MACD Bull Cross (0.8 confidence). Critically, this shift is occurring while the price is situated precisely at a significant technical support level, defined by the cluster of Fibonacci signals (Confluence and 78.6% Retrace), suggesting the correction phase may be complete.\n\n4. **Risk Factor:** Technical Support Failure\n    The primary risk is a failure to hold the currently identified Fibonacci support zone (78.6% retrace / Confluence levels). Since the price is relying heavily on these specific technical anchors, a decisive breach below this support would negate the bullish momentum cross and signal further downside correction.\n\n5. **Action:** Long Position Initiation/Addition\n    Given the confluence of strong structural support and momentum reversal, traders should look to initiate or add to long positions, using the identified Fibonacci support zone as a critical stop-loss threshold to manage downside risk.",
