    "signal_summary": "1. **Primary Bias:** BEARISH - Structural weakness is confirmed as Price is trading below all major moving averages (20, 50, 200), establishing a definitive downtrend (0.8 confidence).\n2. **Key Signal:** PRICE BELOW ALL MAs - This signal confirms a strong structural short bias. The price at $11.42 is trading in established bearish territory, failing to hold both short and long-term support levels.\n3. **Momentum:** Strong Downward - The combination of a bearish MACD and a spread MA ribbon suggests that the current downtrend is established and being driven by consistent selling pressure, rather than being consolidated.\n4. **Risk Factor:** Time-Based Inflection - The alignment with FIB TIME ZONE 5 flags that a time-based volatility spike or short-term reversal may be imminent, suggesting increased risk for existing short positions despite the strong technical structure.\n5. **Action:** Maintain or initiate short positions. Focus on utilizing resistance levels (near-term MAs) for high-probability entries, but manage risk tightly due to the approaching Fibonacci time zone volatility cue.",
